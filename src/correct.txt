terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap
terminal 1 and the positive terminal are not connected
terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal
terminal 1 is not separated from the negative battery terminal
terminal 1 and the positive battery terminal are in different electrical states
there is a gap between terminal 1 and the positive terminal
terminal 1 is not connected to the positive battery terminal
there was a gap between terminal 1 and the positive terminal
because terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal
because terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal
because terminal 1 was connected to the negative terminal of the battery
terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap
terminal 1 and the positive terminal are not connected
terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal
terminal 1 is not separated from the negative battery terminal
terminal 1 and the positive battery terminal are in different electrical states
because they are connected to opposite terminals
beacuse terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal and the battery is connected at the positive terminal
the gap causes terminal 1 to have a negative battery characteristic which is different compared  to the positive battery terminal
there was no gap between terminal 1 and the negative battery terminal
because terminal 1 is seperated from the positive battery terminal
terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal
terminal one is connected to the negative battery terminal
there is a gap between the postive terminal and terminal 1
because terminal is connected to the negative terminal
because terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal
terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal so the voltage reading is 1.5 v
the positive and the negative sides of the battery are separated by the gap
terminal 1 is not connected to the positive terminal
terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal
because terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal which has a 1.5 volt difference with the positive terminal
terminal 1 is connected to the negative battery terminal and is in a different state than the positive battery terminal
postive terminal is not connected to 1    
terminal 1 is not connected to the positive battery terminal
