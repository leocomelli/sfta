because i dont know
the positive terminal has a 1.5 v charge and terminal one has a 0.00 v
the bulb isnt connected to the positive battery terminal
terminal 1 is connected to the positive terminal
because the meter measures the difference between the two terminals
the leads of the voltmeter were reversed therefore the voltages were also reversed
because you are measuring the + current
because the voltage of the battery on the closed circuit is the same as the batterys original voltage
i do not know
because it is not connected to the negative terminal
because it is connected to the positive terminal
because there is no gap between terminal 1 and the positive terminal
because terminal 1 is connected to the positive terminal with no gaps
it was a mistake i looked at it wrong
we switched the terminals around
there was a gap in b the measurement between the positive battery terminal and terminal 1 was 1.5v
he path is not closed the distance between the positive battery terminal and terminal a is 1.5v
terminal 1 was connected to the positive terminal of the battery
because it was connected to the positive terminal
because there was no gap from the positive terminal of the battery
because 1.5 v minus 0 v equals 1.5 v
the voltage is the difference between the electrical state of the terminals
terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal of the battery and has 0 v and the positive terminal of the battery has 1.5 v
because the meter read the difference in volts between the positive battery terminal and terminal 1 which has a negative charge
meter read the difference in volts between the positive battery terminal and terminal 1 which is connected to the negative battery terminal
bulb terminals 3 and 4
i dont know
there was no gap between the circuit
there was no gap between terminal 1 and the positive battery terminal
because there was no gap
because it was connected to the positive terminal
because terminal 1 had no gap
because they were connected to the positive terminal
because there is a gap between terminal 3 and 4
there wasnt a gap
the voltage doesnt change
the gap is open
the paths are seperated
the terminal was connected to the positive battery
the terminals were connected to the positive terminals of the battery
there is no gap between the terminals
i dont know
there was a gap in bulb b
circuit was complete until gap
gap
gap battery and electricity
there was no gap
they are in a closed circuit
there is no gap
i doesntt know
there is a gap in the path
there is no gap in the path
there is a gap in the circuit
dont know
there is no gapp between the positive terminal and terminal 1
there is no gap between terminal 1 and the positive terminal
it was connected to the positive terminal
terminal 1 was connected to the positive terminal
terminal 1 was not connected to the negative terminal
fjdajf
terminal 1 was connected to the positive terminal
terminal 1 was connected to the positive battery terminal
whatever
the positive terminal has 1.5 v
voltage is the difference between a positive and negative end on the battery
voltage is the difference between a positive and negative terminal on the battery
the positive terminal
the positive terminal is connected to the bulb
because 1.5 v is the difference between the positive terminal and terminal 1
the positive terminal and terminal 1 read 1.5 v because the difference across the terminals is 1.5 v
the voltage between terminal 1 and the positive terminal is 1.5 v
?
i  do not know
there is a gap after bulb b
there is a gap after bulb b
all components are in a closed circuit
terminal 1 is connected to the 1.5 volt battery
i dont know
because terminal 1 and the neavtive terminal are seperated
they created a circut
the posotive battery and terminal 1 created a circut
there was no gap in the circut
because of the gap that bulb b created
because positive charge is before gap
positive before gap
positive connects to negative
terminal negative
terminal 1 is connected to the positive terminal
i dont know actually
because the gap does not affect the posistive terminal
because there is no gap between the terminals
the gap
the posititve terminal is not damaged
because they are flipped
because it was connected to the positive side
they are different electrical states
the electrical state at the terminal matches the batterys electrical state
because the voltage meter was connected to a positive and negative side
because it was not connect to the negative end of the terminal
because voltage measures the difference between two points
i do not know
not sure
it was connected to the positive terminal
the difference between the electrical states is 1.5 volts
because there was a closed circuit
because the positive terminal is in a closed path
it is connected to the positive terminal
terminal one is connected to a positive battery terminal
because it was attached to the postive terminal
different states
there is a difference of 1.5 volts between terminal 1 and the positive terminal
terminal 1 and the positive terminal are connected
because the meter was hooked up to two sides of the battery
because terminal 1 had both a positive and negative charge
i am not sure
because the positive circuit has a voltage of 1.5 volts
because terminal 1 was hooked u to the positive terminal which is automatically 1.5 v
